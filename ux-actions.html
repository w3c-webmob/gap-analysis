    <h2>Status</h2>
    <p>This is a draft, work-in-progress analysis derived from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/Closing_the_gap_with_native">“Closing
        the Gap with Native” Headlight task force</a>.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>To compare the various existing application development approaches, two
      broad perspectives can be taken:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>End-user perspective:</dt>
      <dd>How will a development approach provide the best possible user experience?</dd>
      <dt>Content and service provider perspective:</dt> 
      <dd>How will the development approach affect their costs and benefits?</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>This document, based on the analysis of <a href="http://w3c-webmob.github.io/gap-analysis/ux-webapps.html">how Web apps
        currently fare from a user experience perspective</a>, discusses some
      possible actions that could be pursued by W3C members to reduce Web apps weaknesses and
      increase their existing advantages.</p>
    <p>See also the <a href="http://w3c-webmob.github.io/gap-analysis/provider-comparison-framework.html">framework to compare mobile apps development
        approaches from a provider perspective</a>.</p>
    <h2>Action plan to improve the User Experience of Web Applications</h2>

<p class="issue">These are very sketchy ideas that need to be further developed and turned into concrete action plans if and when they're deemed appropriate.</p>
<h3>Discovery and acquisition</h3>
<h4>Searching an app</h4>
          <p>Increase searchability of apps through better metadata</p>

<p class="issue">This is SEO issue.</p>

<h4>Reaching an app from physical artifacts (ads, paper magazines, TV
            screen, product labels)</h4>
          <p>Enable over the air discovery for <a href="http://designmind.frogdesign.com/blog/mobile-apps-must-die.html">Just-in-time
              interactions</a></p>
<p class="issue">This seems far out into the future. The platform has more immidiate problems.</p>

<h4>Reaching an app from on-line interactions (social networks,
            on-line reviews, etc.)</h4>
    <p>Promote best practices of URI management for client-side apps.</p>

<h4>Paying for an app</h4>
          <p>Enable simple payments on the Web</p>

<p class="issue">Need to describe the limitations of existing solutions.</p>

<h4>Downloading an app</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable large download optimizations</li>
    <li>Fix offline</li>
    <li>Integrate off-line Web apps in list of available OS apps</li>
  </ul>

<p class="issue">First point is already covered by HTTP2. Fixing offline is 
service workers. 3 is an implementation detail.</p>
        
<h4>Authorizing an app for special privileges</h4>
          
    <ul>
      <li>Allow Web apps to manage group of permissions?</li>
      <li>Enforce consent-through-interaction pattern?</li>
    </ul>
  
<h3>Finding on device and launching</h3>
<h4>Locating the app launcher</h4>
         <p>Get browsers/OS vendors to simplify integration of Web apps in OS
            apps list</p>
          <p>Get browsers to better support HTML capabilities for "bookmarking" to homescreen.</p>
             
<h4>Starting the app</h4>
          
    <ul>
      <li>Use manifest as a way to promote Singleton enforcement?</li>
      <li>Saved Web apps should be started under their own branding
        (fullscreen, optional splash screen)</li>
    </ul>

<p class="issue">The first point presuposes a manifest as a solution. 
  that is not the right way to frame this problem: the manifest
  may be one solution... there may be other solutions!</p>

<p class="issue">Regarding own branding, this should be left up to the author.
Splash screens are already supported in the platform (index.html can serve as 
splash screen).</p> 
  
<h4>Waiting for the app to be ready to use</h4>
          
<ul>
  <li>Provide better hooks for optimizing start time (e.g. for
    scripts loading, assets loading)</li>
  <li>Promote best practices</li>
</ul>

<p class="issue">First item is an implementation detail.</p>

<h3>Intuitiveness and ease of
            understanding</h3>
<h4>Adopting familiar user interfaces</h4>
<p>CSS should provide some level of system UI integration?</p>

<p class="issue">Browsers already do this through markup. CSS is not the correct layer. Also, this is generally considered bad practice: the experience provided by the application should be unique - not a copy of system ui conventions.</p>

<h4>Adopting familiar user interaction patterns</h4>
          
<ul>
  <li>More DOM Events to match specific patterns</li>
  <li>Indie UI should help</li>
</ul>

<p class="issue">This pressuposes various solutions - it should be generalilzed.</p>  

<h4>Guiding the user</h4>

<h3>Smoothness and responsiveness</h3>
<h4>Navigating through views provided by the app</h4>
          
<ul>
  <li>Get browsers to disable it under the right conditions (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=133391">à
      la Chrome</a>)</li>
  <li>Promote work-arounds (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick">FastClick)</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="issue">Promoting workarounds does not address problems in the platform.</p>

<h4>Interacting within a given view of the app</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Provide better hooks for managing scrolling (e.g. Scrolling
    events)</li>
  <li>Promote best practices and libraries</li>
  <li>Provide more control on memory management?</li>
</ul>
 
<p class="issue">Smooth scrolling is independent of events. See, for example, <code>position: sticky</code>.</p> 

<h4>Obtaining content from the network</h4>          
  <ul>
    <li>Background network operations.</li>
    <li>Priority handling in network ops.</li>
  </ul>

<p class="issue">Need to work with Web Perf WG on this... in particular
  with regards to the <cite>Resource Priorities</cite> spec.</p> 

<h4>Pushing content to the network</h4>
          
<ul>
  <li>Background network operations</li>
  <li>Priority handling in network ops</li>
</ul>

<p class="issue">
  Need to describe use case here. This can be handled in various was depending on the use case. 
</p>

<h3>Adaptability to user access requirements</h3>
<h4>Making the user interface flexible to different user requirements</h4>
<p>Automated or semi-automated testing tools?</p>
<p class="issue">Need to flesh this out...</p>
<h4>Integrating with the accessibility services on the device</h4>
<p>[further analysis required]</p>
<p class="issue">This should be handled by markup. Better question is: what is missing from the markup to make this happen?</p>
<h3>Sensitivity to context</h3>
<h4>Determining the context in which the user is</h4>
<p>Any critical sensor missing (indoor location via WiFi id? BT4?)? Can
            we build a more generic sensor API that doesn't work against the
            user privacy?</p>
<h4>Notifying the user of a context-relevant information</h4>         
<ul>
  <li>Progress on Push API</li>
  <li>Look into registering wake-up for Web apps (on top of
    notifications?)?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Personalization and privacy</h3>
<h4>Gaining access to private data</h4>
          <p>Web Intents-like solution?</p>
<h4>Protecting user privacy</h4>          
<ul>
  <li>Common strategy toward iframe handling?</li>
  <li>DNT</li>
</ul>
          
<h3>Immersivity and focus</h3>
<h4>Managing the whole screen space</h4>
<p>Fullscreen API to the rescue?</p>
<h4>Separating UI from other apps</h4>
          
            <p>Make it possible run Web app fullscreen, in separate browser
            instance?</p>
          
<h3>Ease of returning to once launched</h3>
<h4>Finding quickly the list of already launched apps</h4>
          
<ul>
  <li>Allow singleton-enforcement for Web apps</li>
  <li>Include Web apps in tasks list</li>
</ul>

<p class="issue">This is a UX issue.</p>
      
<h4>Waiting for the app to be re-activated</h4>
          
<h4>Getting the app back in the state it was left</h4>
 <p>[Investigate further which states are hard to restore]</p>
<h3>Ease of obtaining additional features</h3>
<h4>Paying for an add-on</h4>
          <p>Enable simple payments on the Web</p>
<p class="issue">Is this in-app payments?</p>
<h4>Downloading the add-on</h4>
        <p>Enable large download optimizations</p>
<p class="issue">Covered by HTTP2</p>
<h4>Authorizing the add-on for special privileges</h4>
<p class="issue">Presupposes some special security model.</p> 
<h3>Ease of maintaining</h3>
<h4>Updating an app</h4>
<p class="issue">Covered by HTTP2, service workers.</p>
          
<h4>Retrieving locally stored app data</h4>
<p>Filesystem API?</p>
<p class="issue">Need use case.</p>
<h4>Removing an app</h4>
          
<h4>Purging an app configuration and stored data</h4>
<p class="issue">This is UX problem.</p> 

<h3>Ease of cross devices usage</h3>
<h4>Locating a compatible version of the app on the various devices</h4>
          <p>Reduce incompatibilities across devices.</p>
<h4>Acquiring (possibly with payment) the app on these devices</h4>

<h4>Getting the content / configuration of the app synchronized across
            devices</h4>
          
<ul>
  <li>Standardized identity management</li>
  <li>Easy synchronization for Web dbs?</li>
  <li>Discovery of other nearby devices</li>
</ul>
          
<h4>Making the app work on several devices at the same time</h4>
          
<ul>
  <li>WebRTC</li>
  <li>UX guidance on cross-device apps</li>
</ul>
